# Stax

## About

Stax creates and manages CloudFormation stacks (aka stax) in AWS ([Amazon Web Services](aws.amazon.com)).  Several CloudFormation templates are provided with stax, take a look at them in the `templates` directory to modify and create your own.

As an illustration, with the proper configuration and templates, `stax` can create a set of entities in AWS like those shown in the diagram below.

![AWS Stax Diagram](docs/aws-stax.png)

## Requirements

Stax requires Linux (tested on Debian GNU/Linux 7/8 and Ubuntu 14.04/15.04) and Apple OS X (tested on 10.09/10.10). You'll also need an account with [Amazon Web Services](aws.amazon.com).

### Homebrew (Mac OS X only)

Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) for OS X, which '...installs the stuff you need that Apple didnâ€™t'. Basically it's a \*nix package manager like we have in Linux.  It's easy to install via their setup script:

```
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Visit their site to learn how to install it manually if you don't trust that line.

### curl

Install [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) if you don't already have it installed (OS X has it by default, and most Linux distros have it by default) on your client.

```bash
$ apt-get install curl   # Debian GNU/Linux, Ubuntu
$ yum install curl       # Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS, Amazon Linux
```

### awscli

Install [aws-cli](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli) (Universal Command Line Interface for Amazon Web Services) on your client.

NOTE: the version in the Debian repo is out of date, but we'll need the latest version, to get that we'll first need to install the Python package manager `pip`. These [install docs](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/debian-ubuntu-centos-rhel-linux-install-pipclient/] will help you get `pip` installed, once complete, go to the next step to install `awscli`.

```bash
$ pip install awscli  # Debian GNU/Linux, Ubuntu
$ brew install awscli     # Apple OS X ([via Homebrew](http://brew.sh/))
$ yum install awscli      # Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS, Amazon Linux
```

After installing the AWS CLI, you will need to configure it with your AWS access credentials, specifically an AWS API key and secret.  You can generate these credentials from your [IAM user page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#users) on the AWS Console. Choose your username, scroll down to Security Credentials > Access Keys (Acess Key ID and Secret Access Key), and click Create Keys if you haven't created them yet.  Running stax requires many permissions in AWS, so be sure the IAM user you are running stax as has sufficient permissions, and in an admin group (called 'wheel' by default). If you already have this group, and your user is in that group, continue to 'aws configure' - otherwise follow the next steps to setup the 'wheel' group.

NOTE: if this is a new install (the AWS environment hasn't been used before) you'll need to create the wheel group, and add your user to that group for the user to have permissions to build on AWS.

* In the AWS Console, under the Services tab, choose IAM > Groups > Create New Group > Name it 'wheel' > Next Step > Create Group
* Now go into the group to define the 'Inline Policies'. Again, in the AWS Console, under the Services tab, choose IAM > Groups > Choose the new 'wheel' group > Scroll down to 'Inline Policies' and click on that > In that dropdown click 'click here' on the line that says "To create one, click here." - Now choose Custom Policy > Select > In 'Policy Name' call it 'wheel' then under Policy Document, enter the following:

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Click 'Apply Policy' - Now apply your user to that group, click Users > Click your new user > Click Add User to Groups > select the 'wheel' group > Click Add to Groups

Run the AWS configure utility to enter your keys and regions.

```bash
$ aws configure
```

You will be prompted to enter your access key and secret access key, copy this from the AWS Console you opened above.  Next you will be prompted to enter your AWS region, currently we have stax setup to use `us-east-1`.  Finally you will be prompted for the default output format, enter `json`.  The AWS CLI will store your configuration in `~/.aws/credentials`.  If you need to change your configuration, you can either run `aws configure` again or edit this file directly.

## Templates

Two templates are provided with stax to get you started, below are brief descriptions.

### simple.json

The template `template/simple.json` stands up a simple AWS environment.  Since it is simple to comprehend and spins up quickly, this template is intended as a sandbox to stand up and test new CloudFormation entities. For example, the implementation of CloudWatch Alarms was first tested using this template. The `config/simple.json` has minimal parameters and the default values are acceptable for all but the project/team parameters.

*   `Project` __REQUIRED__: Name for the project with which this application ecosystem is associated
*   `Product` __REQUIRED__: Name for the end-user facing product service by this application ecosystem
*   `Group` __REQUIRED__: Name of the group that created this stack
*   `Team` __REQUIRED__: Name of the team that created this stack
*   `Environment` __REQUIRED__: Type of environment, e. g., production, test, branch name
*   `KeepAlive` __REQUIRED__: Tag to avoid the reaper, default is false
*   `InstanceType`: AWS EC2 instance type for NAT instances, default is t2.micro
*   `Owner` __REQUIRED__: Tag for owner of the stack, if set to `@OWNER@` stax will substitute the current user id
*   `KeyName` __REQUIRED__: AWS EC2 Key Pair to use when launching instances, if set to `@KEY_NAME@` stax will use a key pair it creates
*   `SSHLocation`: CIDR IP range to allow SSH access to bastion host, if set to `@SSH_FROM@` stax will replace it with the CIDR IP of the host running stax, default is 0.0.0.0/0

### vpc-default.json

The template `template/vpc-default.json` creates an environment useful for deploying microservices as docker containers in AWS.  The following entities are created:

* __1 VPC__ (vpc-) Isolated Virtual Private Cloud network.
* __1 EC2 instance__ Bastion Host (bastion-) Provides SSH access to
  the VPC.
* __2 EC2 instances__ NAT boxes (nat1-, nat2-) Proxy network
  connections to and from the internal CoreOS hosts to the public
  internet.  These instances log all traffic and monitor each other to
  ensure high availability.
* __2 Elastic Load Balancers__ Gateway ELB (gateway-elb-) Load balancer
  for service and web traffic to the Gateway Cluster
* __1 Auto Scaling Group__ Gateway Cluster (gateway-) An auto scaling
  group with a default size of 2 of instances running CoreOS.
  The instances serve as the gateway/router to the internal service
  instances.
* __3 EC2 Instances__ Service Leaders (service-leader-N-) Three
  instances with CloudWatch Alarms for auto-recovery should they fail
  that serve as the cluster leaders for etcd and consul.
* __1 Auto Scaling Group__ Service Cluster (service-) An auto scaling
  group with a default size of zero on which, along with the service
  leaders, all services deployed to the VPC will run.

The text in parentheses is the first part of the name given to the entity, with the latter part being the CloudFormation stack name.

This template takes the following parameters, see `config/vpc-default.json.example` for the format.

*   `Project` __REQUIRED__: Name for the project with which this
    application ecosystem is associated
*   `Product` __REQUIRED__: Name for the end-user facing product
    service by this application ecosystem
*   `Group` __REQUIRED__: Name of the group that created this stack
*   `Team` __REQUIRED__: Name of the team that created this stack
*   `Environment` __REQUIRED__: Type of environment, e. g., production, test, branch name
*   `KeepAlive` __REQUIRED__: Tag to avoid the reaper, default is false
*   `Owner` __REQUIRED__: Tag for owner of the stack, if set to `@OWNER@` stax will
    substitute the current user id
*   `KeyName` __REQUIRED__: AWS EC2 Key Pair to use when launching instances, if set
    to `@KEY_NAME@` stax will use a key pair it creates
*   `ServiceELBSubdomainName`: Route 53 subdomain, leave blank to not
    create one

    clustering, private or public, default is private, use public to
    cluster across unpaired VPCs
*   `AutoScaleCooldown`: Auto scaling cooldown period, in seconds, after
    an auto scaling event, default is 300
*   `AllowSSHFrom`: CIDR IP range to allow SSH access to bastion host,
    if set to `@SSH_FROM@` stax will replace it with the CIDR IP of the
    host running stax
*   `AllowHTTPFrom`: CIDR IP range from which to allow HTTP access to
    the Gateway ELB, if set to `@HTTP_FROM@` stax will replace it with
    the CIDR IP of the host running stax

```

* Create a stax cluster on AWS. __WARNING: This will cost you money!__

```bash
$ ./stax --config=config/vpc-default.json --template=template/vpc-default.json create
```

* Watch for any errors.

## Accessing the cluster

It will take ~5 minutes to build, you can test if it's ready by trying
to connect.

```bash
$ ./stax connect
```

The command will check if the cluster is built, and if it is, it will
populate the bastion host with needed information and then connect you
to it.

* You can access specific hosts in the Gateway Cluster and Service Cluster using the following commands:

```bash
$ ./stax connect gateway[N]
$ ./stax connect service[N]
```

* You can get information about the fleet cluster with the `fleet` command:

```bash
$ ./stax fleet
```

* You can test the general operation of the stack with the `check` command:

```bash
$ ./stax check
```

* You can get a list of service stax knows how to deploy with the following command:

```bash
$ ./stax services
```

* You can deploy one of those services using the start command:

```bash
$ ./stax start SERVICE
```

replacing `SERVICE` with the name of the service you want to deploy.
The service deployment is done using `fleet`.

* You can create a PostgreSQL RDS instance with the following command:

```bash
$ ./stax rds PASSWORD
```

replacing `PASSWORD` with a password you will need to connect to the
database.

## Destroying the cluster

To delete the stack and the other entities stax creates as part of its management, e. g., the S3 bucket, EC2 Key Pair, and RDS instances, run the following command: 

```bash
$ ./stax delete
```

## stax.config

An optional customization configuration file is available at `config/stax.config`, which allows you to specify option parameters for your stax. Currently the file allows customization of the prefix stax uses to name your stax, an ssh jumpbox you might have to proxy through to get to your stax, and integration with [Slack](https://slack.com/).

```
## stax.config - optional parameters specific to your environment

# the prefix for the name of your stax, default is "stax"
STAX_TAG_PREFIX=""

# the IP of a ssh 'jumpbox' to proxy SSH connections to your VPC
STAX_JUMP=""

# the webhook URL to allow stax to post to a slack channel (#stax by default)
# see https://slack.com/services/ for setup documentation
STAX_SLACK_WHOOK=""
```

* To install stax.config

```
cp config/stax.config.example ~/.stax.config
```

* Edit the contents of `~/.stax.config` and enter your values

Now, running stax will see that file and source it, using the found variables over any others in the `config` directory.

## Stax Studio

Stax, besides being a clever take on the word stacks, is named after
the famous Stax Recording Studio in Memphis, TN. If you're ever in
Memphis, visit the awesome
[Stax Museum](http://www.staxmuseum.com/)... it's far more interesting
than Sun Studios, but I digress.
